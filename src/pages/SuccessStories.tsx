                Fresh Start Bakery was throwing away dozens of unsold bread loaves and pastries each day. Through 
                FoodRescue Connect, they connected with Sunrise Shelter, which now picks up these items three times 
                a week to serve to homeless individuals in the community.

                After a large corporate event was canceled at the last minute, Green Plate Catering had prepared food 
                for 200 people with nowhere to go. Through our platform, they connected with a local community kitchen 
                that was able to pick up the food within hours and distribute it to families in need.
